The two ways AUC students can utilize Mimi's Pantry is by pre-registering for our weekly prepacked dinner bags or “shopping” in our main pantry. The dinner bags include all the ingredients students would need to cook meals such as beef or turkey tacos, chicken alfredo, and impossible burgers. When students utilize our “shopping-like” experience, they have access to a large array of dry, fresh, frozen, and vegan items of their choosing in the pantry. This dual access process assure that our pantry is aligned with our corporate sponsor's mission of zero food waste",
