# Meal Map 
Meal Map is a website that enables users to locate pantries in their local neighborhoods. The site also provides information on finding shelters, hunger relief organizations, and government assistance programs. 

By using design thinking, TypeScript, React.js, accessibility primer, DevOps, and debugging, I aim to create a functional and efficient website that allows users to find local pantries and shelters, access resources, and add new locations. The goal of Meal Map is to connect individuals with the resources they need and provide a platform for organizations to share their services. I believe that the combination of these skills and technologies will result in a powerful tool that will help combat hunger in the Atlanta area.
